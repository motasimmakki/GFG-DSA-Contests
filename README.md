        Boolean Matrix Problem
        <p>In this problem, we have been given a Boolean Matrix and we have to manipulate the given matrix in such a way that if any of the element in a row is 1 then we have to change the complete row with 1. </br>â–ªâ–«Visit: <a href = "https://github.com/motasimmakki/GFG-DSA-Contests/blob/main/Contest%2001/BooleanMatrixProblem.cpp">Click here</a></p>

        Max Sum Without Adjecent
        <p>In this problem, we have to calculate the maximum sum of subsequence in an array in such a way that not any of the chosen two numbers are adjacent to each other. </br>â–ªâ–«Visit: <a href = "https://github.com/motasimmakki/GFG-DSA-Contests/blob/main/Contest%2001/MaxSumWithoutAdjacent.cpp">Click here</a></p>

    Contest 02: Strings
    <ol>
      <li>
        Toogle The Middle
        <p>In the problem,  we have to find the XOR of pairs of array elements such that their XOR gives the result as C.
.
Time Complexity: O(N*N), where N is the number of elements in an array. </br>â–ªâ–«Visit: <a href = "https://github.com/motasimmakki/GFG-DSA-Contests/blob/main/Contest%2002/XOR_Pair.cpp">Click here</a></p>

        Rolling Hash
        <p>In this problem, we have been given a string 's' and a string 'p', where the sum of characters in a string 'p' leads to sum hash which is nothing but the sum of individual character in a string 'p', assuming that a = 1, b = 2 and so on. We have to find all the sub-string in 's' so that they correspond to the same hash as of 'p'.
</br>. </br>
Note that the length of the sub-string in 's' will be the same as of 'p', and we have to print the sub-string and their starting index.
</br>. </br>
Time Complexity: O(len(s) * len(p))
</br>. </br>
#NOTE: The provided solution is correct as it produces the desired output at every test case, but as it is a brute force approach, this solution is not accepted by the GFG Judge System. There is space for improvement in this algorithm. </br>â–ªâ–«Visit: <a href = "https://github.com/motasimmakki/GFG-DSA-Contests/blob/main/Contest%2002/RollingHash.cpp">Click here</a></p>

        Max Sum Without Adjecent
        <p>In this problem, we have to find the average of string, the average of string can be calculated as the sum of all the ASCII values of characters in a string divided by the number of characters in a string.
</br>. </br>
Time Complexity: O(len(s)), where 's' denoted the string. </br>â–ªâ–«Visit: <a href = "https://github.com/motasimmakki/GFG-DSA-Contests/blob/main/Contest%2002/AvgOfString.cpp">Click here</a></p>

        Minimum At Pop
        <p>In this problem, we have to change the property of the Stack such that whenever the 'pop()' function is called, the minimum element from the stack is popped out.

        Pairing the brackets
        <p>In this problem, we have been given a string containing the opening and the closing parenthesis, and we have to pair the leftmost opening parenthesis with the rightmost closing parenthesis, and then print their indices.
